# tic-tac-toe-react
Based on the tutorial on the official react documentation page: https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

Main learning points:
React components are stateful
{} to access JS, otherwise returning HTML components
state, setState are most important to remember


Interesting point:
    By default, all child components re-render automatically when the state of the parent component changes.
    This includes even the child components that weren't affected by the change (you might want to avoid this for performance reasons)
